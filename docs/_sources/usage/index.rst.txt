Getting Access
##############

This site is open to registered users only. However, since some of the
information available here is sensitive access to those pages is restricted to
current **HAFFA** members and authorized guests.

Logging In
**********

Click on the **Login** link at the top of this page. You will be asked to
provide your registered user name and password to access to the site.

For new users, click on the **register** link on the **Login** page to sign up.
You will need to pick a user name and password, and provide a valid email
address. Passwords are not stored directly, so you need to remember your
password. If you forget your password, click on **Forgot Password** and a
change password request can be sent to the registered email address.

Once you complete the registration step, you will have limited guest-only
access to the site. After the club secretary validates your membership status,
access rights will be raised to full member access.
